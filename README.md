## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)
- [Groq API Key](https://groq.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the source code).

2.  **Backend Setup**:
    - Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
    - Install dependencies: `npm install`
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following credentials:
      ```env
      MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
      PORT=5000
      ```
    - Start the server: `node server.js`

3.  **Frontend Setup**:
    - Open the `frontend/dashboard.html` file in your web browser.
    - (Optional) If running locally with a backend, you may need to adjust the API base URL in `frontend/js/api.js` to match your backend server address (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
